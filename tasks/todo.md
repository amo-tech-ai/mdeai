## 🔴 Red flags / blockers / failure points

Catalogued for visibility — see "Phase B" below for fixes.

| # | Severity | Issue | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R1** | 🔴 **PRE-LAUNCH BLOCKER** | **Money path broken** — `booking-create` + `payment-webhook` edge functions don't exist. UX implies bookings work; back end stops at row insertion. No payment confirmation, no host notification, no Stripe webhook. | Phase B item B2 |
| **R2** | 🟡 HIGH | **Zero E2E Playwright tests.** Every PR ships on manual smoke + unit tests only. Regression risk is increasing with the velocity. | Phase B item B1 |
| **R3** | 🟡 HIGH | **Admin RBAC not enforced server-side.** `user_roles` table exists, no edge fn checks it. Admin endpoints are gated by client-side route guards only. | Phase B item B4 |
| **R4** | 🟡 HIGH | **Sentry / PostHog not yet observed in real prod.** Vars set, init verified, bundle has literals — but no real event has been confirmed in `app.posthog.com` Live Events / Sentry dashboard. SDKs could be silently failing in some browser contexts. | Phase A item A8 |
| **R5** | 🟡 MEDIUM | **Stripe / PSP decision still TBD** (Stripe-only vs Wompi/local for COP). Blocks B2 implementation. | Open Decisions §1 |
| **R6** | 🟡 MEDIUM | **In-memory rate limiter** (`_shared/rate-limit.ts`) resets per edge invocation. Acceptable for MVP, fails at scale. Durable Postgres-backed limiter migration exists (`20260423120000_durable_rate_limiter.sql`) but not yet wired to all functions. | Phase B item B6 |
| **R7** | 🟡 MEDIUM | **Email confirmation flow loses pending prompt** — sessionStorage is per-tab. Documented limitation; user opens email link in new tab → prompt lost. | Phase D item D7 |
| **R8** | 🟢 LOW | **`Conversation.user_id` typed as `string`** — anon-vs-uuid bug class previously hit at runtime (now fixed at runtime, type still loose). | Phase A item A4 |
| **R9** | 🟢 LOW | **MapProvider is chat-only** — apartment detail / trips pages don't share pin state. | Phase C items C1, C2 |
| **R10** | 🟢 LOW | **2 fast-refresh warnings in `MapContext.tsx`** — non-component exports trigger react-refresh rule. HMR-only, no correctness impact. | Phase A item A3 |
| **R11** | 🟢 LOW | **Auth-redirect Suspense flash** — authed users landing on `/` see ~50–200 ms spinner before ChatCanvas chunk loads. | Phase A item A1 |
| **R12** | 🟢 LOW | **`viewport_idle` PostHog event TYPED but not emitted.** | Phase A item A6 |

## 📋 NEXT — Sequenced 22-item plan (4 phases)

Each phase is one PR. Items within a phase can ship together. Order respects dependencies (an item's "unblocks" target is downstream).

### Phase A — Quick wins batch (target: 1 PR, ~6 hrs)

Compound improvements with low review surface. Ship before Phase B starts.

- [x] **A5 — Regenerate `database.types.ts`** — **DONE 2026-04-28 evening**. Removed the local rpc cast from `track-outbound.ts`; `log_outbound_click` is now fully typed via the canonical Database type.
- [ ] **A1 — Pre-fetch `ChatCanvas` chunk on Home mount** — kills the auth-redirect Suspense flash (R11). One-line `import('@/components/chat/ChatCanvas')` in Home's `useEffect`. ~5 min. **Files**: `src/pages/Home.tsx`.
- [ ] **A2 — Lazy-mount `<GadgetProvider>` only on `/coffee`** — drops the 24 KB gzip Gadget chunk from every non-coffee route. Move provider into a route-scoped wrapper. ~30 min. **Files**: `src/App.tsx`, possibly new `src/components/CoffeeProviderShell.tsx`.
- [ ] **A3 — Split `MapContext.tsx`** — move `MapPin` / `RentalPinMeta` / `PIN_CATEGORY_CONFIG` to `src/types/map-pin.ts`. Kills 2 fast-refresh warnings (R10) + improves HMR speed. ~15 min. **Files**: new `src/types/map-pin.ts`, `MapContext.tsx`, ~3 import sites.
- [ ] **A4 — Tighten `Conversation.user_id` to `uuid \| 'anon'`** — compile-time bug-class prevention (R8). ~30 min. **Files**: `src/types/chat.ts` + 3-4 call sites.
- [ ] **A6 — Add `viewport_idle` PostHog event emission** — already typed in the union, ChatMap idle listener has the data, just no `trackEvent({name:'viewport_idle',...})` call (R12). ~10 min. **Files**: `src/components/chat/ChatMap.tsx`.
- [ ] **A7 — Cloud Console Maps key — quota + budget alarm** — 30 min user-side action. Prevents bill surprises if the key leaks. **Files**: none (Google Cloud Console).
- [ ] **A8 — Verify Sentry / PostHog in real prod** — submit a hero prompt on `www.mdeai.co`, confirm `prompt_send` arrives in PostHog Live Events; force a synthetic Sentry error and confirm it lands in the dashboard. Closes R4. ~15 min. **Files**: none.

**Phase A acceptance:** all 8 boxes checked + lint/build/tests pass + bundle audit confirms `chunkSizeWarningLimit` not regressed.

---

### Phase B — Production readiness (target: 1 PR per item, sequenced)

Pre-launch blockers. **R1 (money path) must ship before any public marketing push.**

- [ ] **B1 — Playwright E2E for Week 2 exit-test path** — `search rentals → save 2 → add 1 to trip → click outbound to Airbnb → verify outbound_clicks row`. Covers the highest-traffic happy-path. ~6 hrs. **Files**: `playwright.config.ts` (already present), new `e2e/week2-exit-test.spec.ts`. Unblocks confident merging of every subsequent PR.
- [ ] **B2 — `booking-create` edge function** ⚠️ **R1 PRE-LAUNCH BLOCKER**. Validates dates / availability, creates `bookings` row with idempotency key, dispatches host notification (email + future WhatsApp). Depends on Open Decisions §1 (Stripe vs Wompi). ~1 day. **Files**: `supabase/functions/booking-create/index.ts`, `supabase/functions/_shared/notifications.ts`.
- [ ] **B3 — `payment-webhook` edge function** ⚠️ **R1 PRE-LAUNCH BLOCKER**. Stripe signature verification; flips `bookings.payment_status` → confirmed; idempotency-key dedupe. ~1 day. **Files**: `supabase/functions/payment-webhook/index.ts`.
- [ ] **B4 — Admin RBAC server-side** — read `user_roles` in every admin edge fn before action. ~4 hrs. **Files**: new `_shared/admin-guard.ts`, every admin fn.
- [ ] **B5 — CSP headers + security audit** — set `Content-Security-Policy` on Vercel; verify no inline scripts after lazy-load refactor. ~2 hrs. **Files**: `vercel.json` (or `next.config` equivalent).
- [ ] **B6 — Wire durable rate-limiter RPC** — replace in-memory `_shared/rate-limit.ts` with the `check_rate_limit` Postgres RPC (migration already shipped at `20260423120001`). ~3 hrs. **Files**: `supabase/functions/_shared/rate-limit.ts`, every fn that calls it.
- [ ] **B7 — Sentry release tagging** — set `release: <commit SHA>` in `initSentry()` so dashboard groups errors by deploy. ~30 min. **Files**: `src/lib/sentry.ts`, `vite.config.ts` (define plugin).
- [ ] **B8 — Showing-reminder pg_cron** (T-24h + T-1h) — closes the lead-to-booking loop. ~3 hrs. **Files**: new migration with `pg_cron` jobs invoking edge fn that posts to email + WhatsApp.

**Phase B acceptance:** R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 closed. All edge functions enforced server-side; CSP shipped; first synthetic Sentry release tag confirmed.

---

### Phase C — Mindtrip parity (each: half-day, dependency-ordered)

Visual + interaction parity on the maps surface. Ships after Phase A.

- [ ] **C1 — `MapContext` → zustand store, lifted to root `<App>`** — single pin store across `/chat`, `/apartments/:id`, `/trips/:id`. Closes R9. ~3 hrs. **Files**: new `src/stores/map-store.ts`, `App.tsx`, all `useMapContext()` call sites.
- [ ] **C2 — `MapShell` reusable component** — single map renderer for 3 surfaces. Pulls clustering + InfoWindow + lifecycle into one place. Depends on C1. ~1 day. **Files**: new `src/components/map/MapShell.tsx`, refactor ChatMap + GoogleMapView to consume it.
- [ ] **C3 — `useMarkerLayer` hook** — dedup ChatMap + GoogleMapView. After audit § 6 made the patterns symmetric, this is mechanical. ~2 hrs. **Files**: new `src/hooks/useMarkerLayer.ts`, refactor 2 consumers.
- [ ] **C4 — ApartmentDetail bottom map** — show the apartment + nearby restaurants/cafés on the detail page. Big trust signal. Depends on C2. ~3 hrs. **Files**: `src/pages/ApartmentDetail.tsx`.
- [ ] **C5 — Saved pins ❤️ overlay on markers** — bound to `useChatActions.savedIds`. Visual continuity. ~2 hrs. **Files**: ChatMap + RentalCardInline.
- [ ] **C6 — Bidirectional card ↔ pin sync** — card click pans/zooms map (currently only hover syncs). Depends on C2. ~3 hrs. **Files**: `src/stores/map-store.ts`, `RentalCardInline.tsx`, `MapShell`.
- [ ] **C7 — Pre-fetch route chunk on link hover** — `onMouseEnter={() => preload}` on top nav links. ~50 ms warmup → near-instant nav. ~1 hr. **Files**: top nav component.

**Phase C acceptance:** map state shared across 3 surfaces; bottom-map live on ApartmentDetail; visual parity with Mindtrip.

---

### Phase D — Scale + new channels (multi-day, milestone-tracked)

90-day backlog. Order is impact-weighted; each item is its own milestone PR.

- [ ] **D1 — Server-side pin clustering** (Postgis `ST_ClusterDBSCAN`) — scales to 1000+ listings. Today's `MarkerClusterer` is client-only. ~2 days.
- [ ] **D2 — Service-worker tile cache for Maps** — first-paint LATAM 4G perf. **Now meaningful** because vendor chunks rarely change. ~2 days.
- [ ] **D3 — A/B framework via PostHog** — selective preload of `posthog` chunk + experiment flags. ~1 day.
- [ ] **D4 — WhatsApp v1** (Infobip webhook + lead capture + search + reminders) — todo.md Week 7-8 milestone. LATAM messaging norm. ~1 week.
- [ ] **D5 — Walking-distance circles** — visual layer on selected pin. ~half-day.
- [ ] **D6 — Heatmap overlay** — Wi-Fi speed / walkability for nomad targeting. ~1 day.
- [ ] **D7 — Email confirmation flow → cross-tab pending prompt** — broadcast channel + IndexedDB fallback. Closes R7. ~3 hrs.

---

## 🆕 Newly identified (added 2026-04-28 evening)

Not yet phased — review and slot into A / B / C / D:

- [ ] **PostHog dashboard setup** — define funnel + retention queries (prompt → save → outbound → booking). Without dashboards, the events are landing in a black box. ~1 hr (PostHog UI).
- [ ] **Outbound-clicks analytics dashboard** — table now exists; SQL view + Metabase/Looker tile for "top affiliate-tagged URLs / hour". ~2 hrs.
- [ ] **Database backup verification** — confirm Supabase point-in-time recovery is enabled on the production project tier. ~30 min user-side.
- [ ] **Status page** (`status.mdeai.co`) — Better-Stack or Statuspage; subscribe to Vercel + Supabase health. ~1 hr.
- [ ] **Secrets rotation schedule** — quarterly rotation cadence for Shopify CLI token, Admin API token, Gadget secret, Vercel deploy token. Document in CLAUDE.md. ~1 hr.
- [ ] **Domain warm-up / DNS check** — confirm DNS has low TTL during launch + Vercel edge routing for LATAM. ~1 hr.
- [ ] **Outbound-click attribution dashboard alert** — Sentry alert when `log_outbound_click` errors > 1% of calls. ~30 min.

---

## 🎯 Recommended sequencing (next 2-week sprint)

**Week 1 (Mon–Fri, 22 hrs):**
- Day 1–2: **Phase A** (8 items in 1 PR — ~6 hrs total). Gives compounding wins immediately.
- Day 3: **B1 Playwright E2E** (6 hrs). Without this, every PR after Phase A flies blind.
- Day 4–5: **B2 booking-create + B3 payment-webhook** (1.5 days combined). Closes the money-path gap.

**Week 2 (Mon–Fri, 22 hrs):**
- Day 1: **B4 + B5 + B6 + B7** (security batch — RBAC + CSP + durable rate-limit + Sentry release tag). 1 PR.
- Day 2–3: **B8 Showing-reminder cron** (3 hrs) + **C1 MapContext → zustand** (3 hrs) + **C3 useMarkerLayer** (2 hrs). 1 PR each.
- Day 4–5: **C2 MapShell** (1 day) — unblocks C4/C6.

**Why this ordering:**
1. Phase A first — compounding wins ship before bigger work begins; review surface stays small.
2. B1 (Playwright) immediately after — every PR from this point benefits from automated smoke.
3. B2 + B3 (money path) is the last pre-launch blocker — must land before any marketing push.
4. Security batch (B4-B7) ships as one PR — they share `_shared/` infrastructure.
5. Phase C unblocks Mindtrip parity for the 60-day plan; runs in parallel with B once B1 + B2 + B3 are merged.

## DONE 2026-04-28 evening — PR #6 merged + migration deployed

- [x] **PR #6 merged to `main`** — squash-merge `ec92105`. 7 commits on the sprint, all live at `www.mdeai.co` after Vercel auto-deploy.
- [x] **`outbound_clicks` migration deployed to hosted Supabase** — applied via Supabase MCP `apply_migration`. Table + indexes + RLS + `log_outbound_click` RPC all confirmed via `information_schema` + `pg_indexes` + `role_routine_grants` queries.
- [x] **RPC smoke tests passed** — defense-in-depth http(s) regex correctly rejected `javascript:alert(1)` with sqlstate 22023; real insert succeeded with all columns populated; test row deleted post-verification.
- [x] **`apartment_save_counts_rpc` migration registered** — was previously deployed out-of-band; this added it to the migration history table so local + remote are now in sync.
- [x] **`database.types.ts` regenerated** — 3940 lines, includes `outbound_clicks` row + `log_outbound_click` RPC signature.
- [x] **`track-outbound.ts` rpc cast removed** — function call now goes through canonical typed `supabase.rpc('log_outbound_click', ...)`. Type-check + lint clean.

---

## DONE 2026-04-28 — Day 2 / 3 / 4 sprint + audit § 6 + code-split (PR #6, 7 commits)

### Live on `fix/chat-production-hardening` (awaiting PR #6 merge)

**Day 2 (observability + mobile)**
- [x] **Sentry + PostHog activated** — env vars in Vercel (production + preview) + `.env.local`. Wiring code shipped earlier; this turned the no-op switches on. Bundle audit confirms `phc_rpJoH...` + Sentry DSN literals baked into prod build.
- [x] **Mobile fullscreen map drawer** — floating `Map (N)` pill at `bottom-24 right-4` opens a `<Sheet side="bottom">` with the same `<ChatMap />`. MapContext shares pin state. Verified at `375 × 812`; hidden on `md:` and up.

**Day 3 (revenue / SEO loop)**
- [x] **Affiliate attribution + `outbound_clicks`** — migration `20260427210000_outbound_clicks.sql` (table + RLS + `log_outbound_click` RPC) + `src/lib/affiliate.ts` (Booking/Airbnb/VRBO rewriter, **12 unit tests**) + `src/lib/track-outbound.ts` + wired in RentalCardInline (chat surface) + RentalsListingDetail (detail surface). Closes Week 2 exit-test prereq #5.
- [x] **SEO → chat handoff** — "Ask mdeai about this →" CTA on `/apartments/:id` composes a listing-grounded prompt + `savePendingPrompt()` + nav to `/chat?send=pending`. Verified end-to-end (button → URL handoff → auto-fire → 9-listing rental_search payload).

**Day 4 (Mindtrip parity)**
- [x] **InfoWindow peek on pin click** — single InfoWindow instance reused across pins. Peek = photo + title + neighborhood / BR/BA + price/rating + "View details →". Cmd/Ctrl/middle-click + keyboard preserve direct-nav.
- [x] **Booking dialog polish** — review step shows photo strip (snap-x, up to 4 thumbs + "+N more" link) + 2-col amenity grid with check icons (caps at 8). Both render conditionally. Verified end-to-end on Poblado Penthouse listing.

**Audit § 6 (10 surgical fixes + new Vitest)**
- [x] All 10 audit-§-6 items closed in commit `a3a4a4c`. Highlights: GoogleMapView selection-mutation went from O(n) to O(2) DOM rewrites per click; id-keyed marker map (parity with ChatMap); typed `RentalPinMeta`; new `google-maps-loader.test.ts` with 4 Vitests covering shim recursion, script src construction, missing-key rejection, `gm_authFailure` handshake.

**Performance — code-splitting (commit `a802093`)**
- [x] **Entry chunk 597 KB → 118 KB gzip (80% smaller).** 33 routes lazy-loaded behind a Suspense boundary; vendor chunks split into 10 cacheable groups (radix 95 KB / supabase 51 KB / posthog 62 KB / sentry 29 KB / forms 23 KB / gadget 24 KB / dates 18 KB / icons 12 KB / tanstack 12 KB / maps 8 KB gzip). Live-verified: navigating to `/login` triggers 22 new fetches that were NOT in the initial 70-fetch batch.

### Verification (this sprint)
- [x] `npm run lint` — 0 errors on changed files
- [x] `npm run build` — 3.95 s, **51 chunks emitted** (was 1)
- [x] `npm run test` — **44 / 44** across 7 files (was 28 / 28 across 5 — added 12 affiliate tests + 4 google-maps-loader tests)
- [x] `npm run verify:edge` — deno check + 11 / 11 deno tests pass (the "broken" status in todo was stale; now confirmed green)
- [x] Browser smoke (Claude Preview MCP): mobile drawer + desktop layout + observability init + affiliate rewriter + booking review step + lazy chunk fetch — all verified live

### Post-merge actions (queued for after PR #6 lands)
- [ ] `supabase db push` — deploys `outbound_clicks` migration to hosted
- [ ] `supabase gen types typescript --linked` — refreshes `database.types.ts` so `track-outbound.ts` can drop its local rpc cast
- [ ] (Optional, when partner accounts go live) Add `VITE_BOOKING_AID` / `VITE_AIRBNB_AFFILIATE_TAG` / `VITE_VRBO_AFFILIATE_TAG` to Vercel + `.env.local`. Until then, clicks log with `affiliate_tag = NULL` — useful baseline for "we'd have earned X% on Y clicks" analysis
- [ ] Confirm a real PostHog event arrives in `app.posthog.com` Live Events after a hero-prompt submit on www.mdeai.co
- [ ] Confirm a synthetic Sentry error captures (e.g. force `script_load_failed` map telemetry)

---

## DONE 2026-04-27 — Marketing homepage + auth handoff + maps stabilization (PRs #2, #3, #4 to main)

### Live on `www.mdeai.co`
- [x] **Marketing homepage at `/`** — Mindtrip-style centered hero with embedded AI Concierge prompt. Full-width single-column. Logged-in users get a `<Navigate to="/chat" replace />`.
- [x] **AI prompt auth handoff** — anon types prompt → `savePendingPrompt` → `/signup?returnTo=/chat?send=pending` → after auth → ChatCanvas auto-fires once via ref-guard + URL replace. Single sessionStorage key `mdeai_pending_prompt`. 8/8 unit tests.
- [x] **`/chat` route** — anon (3-msg gate) + authed both supported. Auto-fires saved prompt when URL is `/chat?send=pending`.
- [x] **Maps stabilization (full Quick Wins audit)** — singleton loader, `gmp-click` migration, MarkerClusterer, telemetry helper (9 event kinds, pluggable sink), v=quarterly pin, a11y on markers, clearPins on conv switch.
- [x] **Day 1 sprint** — ChatLeftNav (chats + Saved + Trips counts) + "Search this area" pill on viewport idle (Haversine over 8 known neighborhoods → re-fire search).
- [x] **Apartment booking flow** — multi-step BookingDialog, ContactHostDialog with pre-filled inquiry, pricing engine + 12 tests. No DB migration.
- [x] **Critical bug fixes** — blank `/apartments/:id` (CommonJS `require()` shim), anon-UUID 400s + realtime CHANNEL_ERROR loops, double-script load, CORS Allow-Methods missing, auto-fire race with auth state on `/chat?send=pending`.

### Verification (today)
- [x] tsc + build clean
- [x] 28/28 unit tests (5 files)
- [x] Vercel production deploys: 3 successful merges (PR #2/#3/#4)
- [x] Bundle audits on prod: hero strings present, masonry alt-text absent, no `pending_ai_prompt` alias, no `anon-` runtime strings, all 9 telemetry kinds present
- [x] End-to-end smoke from `Origin: https://www.mdeai.co` → 200 OK, streaming SSE, phase events

### Known gaps (informed roadmap, not bugs)
- [x] ~~**No Sentry / PostHog sink**~~ — **wired 2026-04-27 evening**. `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` + `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` + `VITE_POSTHOG_HOST` set in `.env.local` and Vercel (production + preview). Maps telemetry sink forwards every event to Sentry breadcrumbs + captures `*_failed` as Sentry issues + forwards conversion events (`pin_click`, `cluster_expand`, `map_auth_failed`) to PostHog. Bundle audit: `phc_rpJoH...` and `o4510109062...ingest` literals baked into `dist/assets/index-*.js`.
- [ ] **`viewport_idle` event TYPED but not emitted yet** — wired into the "Search this area" feature; emit site lives in ChatMap idle listener (already shipped).
- [ ] **MapProvider is chat-only** — apartment detail and trips pages don't share pin state.
- [x] ~~**Bundle 1.81 MB / ~480 KB gzip**~~ — **resolved 2026-04-28 late-night**. Entry chunk down to 118 KB gzip after vendor splitting + route-level lazy loading. See changelog for full breakdown.
- [x] ~~**`npm run verify:edge` broken** (pre-existing) — `p1-crm/index.ts` deno-imports `@supabase/supabase-js`~~ — **resolved**. Verified 2026-04-28: `npm run verify:edge` runs deno check on all 10 functions + 4 shared modules + 11/11 deno tests pass. The earlier blocker self-resolved (deno fetched the dep on first run; cached for subsequent runs).
- [ ] **Email confirmation flow loses pending prompt** — sessionStorage is per-tab; clicking the email link in a new tab loses the saved prompt. Documented limitation.

## NEXT — Recommended sprint (ranked by Revenue / Growth / UX / Tech / Speed)

### Day 2 — Observability + Mobile (highest leverage) — **all 3 shipped**
- [x] **Wire Sentry SDK** — DSN in `.env.local` + Vercel (prod + preview). `initSentry()` activates, replaces maps-telemetry sink with Sentry breadcrumb + captureException sink for `*_failed` events. Build verified: 8 sentry refs in prod bundle.
- [x] **Wire PostHog** — `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` + `VITE_POSTHOG_HOST` in `.env.local` + Vercel. `initPostHog()` activates, typed `AppEvent` union, 6 call sites already emit (`prompt_send`, `prompt_autofired`, `viewport_search`, `pin_click`, `cluster_expand`, `booking_submitted`). Stale `VITE_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_*` deleted from Vercel.
- [x] **Mobile fullscreen map drawer** — **shipped 2026-04-28**. Floating `Map (N)` pill at `bottom-24 right-4` opens a `<Sheet side="bottom">` with `<ChatMap />` inside. MapContext shares pin state automatically. Verified at `375 × 812`; correctly hidden on `md:` and up.

### Day 3 — Conversion improvements
- [x] **Affiliate attribution + `outbound_clicks` migration** — **shipped 2026-04-27 late evening**. Migration `20260427210000_outbound_clicks.sql` (table + RLS + `log_outbound_click` RPC), `src/lib/affiliate.ts` (Booking/Airbnb/VRBO rewriter, 12 unit tests), `src/lib/track-outbound.ts` (RPC + PostHog event), wired in `RentalCardInline` (chat surface = `chat_card`) + `RentalsListingDetail` (surface = `detail_page`). Env tags optional (`VITE_BOOKING_AID` / `VITE_AIRBNB_AFFILIATE_TAG` / `VITE_VRBO_AFFILIATE_TAG`); clicks log with `affiliate_tag = NULL` until partner IDs are configured. **Closes Week 2 exit-test prerequisite #5.**
- [x] **SEO page → chat handoff** — **shipped 2026-04-28**. "Ask mdeai about this →" button on `/apartments/:id` right rail composes a listing-grounded prompt + `savePendingPrompt` + nav to `/chat?send=pending`. Live-verified: button click → URL handoff → auto-fire → Gemini response with `rental_search` payload of 9 listings.

### Day 4 — Mindtrip parity polish
- [x] **InfoWindow on pin click** — **shipped 2026-04-28**. Single InfoWindow instance reused across pins (Mindtrip pattern). Peek = photo + title + neighborhood/BR/BA + price/rating + "View details →" button. Cmd/Ctrl/middle-click + keyboard preserve direct-nav. Pin meta extended in `ChatCanvas` with `image / rating / bedrooms / bathrooms`. Cleanup closes peek on `pins` change so it can't outlive anchor.
- [x] **Booking dialog polish** — **shipped 2026-04-28**. Review step now shows a horizontal photo strip (snap-x, up to 4 thumbnails + "+N more" link) and a 2-col amenity grid with check icons (caps at 8, "+N more →" if exceeded). Both render conditionally so listings without photos/amenities don't get empty placeholders. Verified end-to-end on `/apartments/30000000...0001` (Poblado Penthouse) → screenshot confirms PHOTOS + WHAT'S INCLUDED sections render correctly above the dates/pricing rows.

### Tech-debt cleanup (anytime, low priority)
- [ ] **`useMarkerLayer` hook** — factor duplication between ChatMap and GoogleMapView. (audit § 6) **PARTIALLY UNBLOCKED:** GoogleMapView refactor in audit-§-6 made the patterns symmetric; extraction is now mostly mechanical.
- [ ] **Custom Cloud Console MapID** — Mindtrip-style muted palette. Pure visual polish. (audit § 90-day)
- [x] **Code-split + lazy-load** map / detail pages — **shipped 2026-04-28 late-night**. Entry chunk 597 KB → **118 KB gzip** (80% smaller). 33 routes lazy-loaded behind a Suspense boundary; vendor chunks split into 10 cacheable tier-2/tier-3 groups (radix, supabase, posthog, sentry, forms, dates, icons, tanstack, maps, gadget). Live-verified: navigating to `/login` triggers 22 new fetches (including `src/pages/Login.tsx`) that were NOT in the initial 70-fetch batch.
- [x] ~~**Fix `npm run verify:edge`**~~ — **resolved 2026-04-28**. `npm run verify:edge` runs deno check + 11 / 11 deno tests pass. The blocker self-resolved after deno cached `@supabase/supabase-js` on first run.
- [ ] **Tighten `Conversation.user_id` type** — currently `string`; pin to `uuid | 'anon'`.

## Code-quality cleanup (audit § 6) — **all 10 shipped 2026-04-28 night**

Small, surgical fixes called out in `tasks/plan/01- MDEAI Maps Architecture Audit.md` § 6. See `changelog` 2026-04-28 night entry for full details.

- [x] **`google-maps-loader.ts` docstring** — example now shows the typed `loadGoogleMapsLibrary<google.maps.MapsLibrary>('maps', key)` form returning the whole library object.
- [x] **`google-maps-loader.ts` dead `void UUID_RE`** — deleted.
- [x] **`google-maps-loader.ts` `_installAuthFailureHandler`** — renamed to underscore-prefixed private. Verified post-rename: module exports are exactly `[isMapsAuthFailed, loadGoogleMapsLibrary, onMapsAuthFailed]`.
- [x] **`google-maps-loader.test.ts`** — new Vitest, 4 tests covering: shim recursion lands in real impl (not stale closure), script src is built correctly (key + loading=async + callback), missing apiKey rejects clearly, `gm_authFailure` toggles `isMapsAuthFailed()`.
- [x] **`ChatMap.tsx` cross-reference** — comment at the top of the component points to ChatCanvas as pin-lifecycle source-of-truth.
- [x] **`ChatMap.tsx` smart `MEDELLIN_CENTER`** — first geo-pinned listing in context wins; falls back to default only when chat hasn't surfaced anything yet.
- [x] **`ChatCanvas.tsx` pin-merge comment** — explicit policy block: each tool response REPLACES pins; two scope-change effects clear; cleanup is intentionally empty.
- [x] **`GoogleMapView.tsx` surgical selection mutation** — split items-update from selection-change; selection-change uses `prevSelectedRef` and only mutates the prev → new pin pair (O(2) DOM rewrites per click vs O(n) before — 50 pins → 50× → 2× rewrites).
- [x] **`GoogleMapView.tsx` id-keyed marker map** — replaced `AdvancedMarkerElement[]` with `Map<string, MarkerEntry>`. Items-update diffs in 3 phases (REMOVE / UPDATE / ADD) so same id reuses DOM + click handler. Listener rewiring eliminated.
- [x] **`MapContext.tsx` `RentalPinMeta`** — typed per-vertical bag added; producers (ChatCanvas) build typed `meta`; consumers (ChatMap InfoWindow) narrow with `as RentalPinMeta` instead of casting field-by-field. `MapPin.meta` stays loosely-typed so new verticals (restaurant/event/attraction) plug in without touching the base.

## 30-day backlog (audit § 7 — "Stabilize + observe")

Items not yet in the Day 2/3/4 sprint but still on the 30-day plan.

- [ ] **Cloud Console quota + budget alarm** on the Maps key — 30 min, you-side action. Prevents bill surprises if the key leaks.
- [ ] **MapContext → zustand store** (or lift to root `<App>`) — required before `MapShell` (each page needs a different layer source). (audit § 6 + 60-day)

## 60-day backlog (audit § 7 — "Mindtrip parity")

- [ ] **`MapShell` component** — single map renderer used by chat / apartment detail / trips. Owns `AdvancedMarkerElement` lifecycle, clustering, InfoWindow. Reusable shell, three call sites. **Unblocks the bottom-map on apartment detail.** (audit § 5 + § 60-day)
- [ ] **Bidirectional card ↔ pin sync** — currently only hover syncs. Card click should pan/zoom the map to the matching pin. (audit § 60-day)
- [ ] **Saved pins ❤️ overlay on markers** — show a small heart on pins the user has saved, bound to `useChatActions.savedIds`. (audit § 60-day)
- [ ] **ApartmentDetail bottom map** — show the apartment + nearby restaurants/cafés on the detail page. Unlocked by `MapShell`. (audit § 60-day)

## 90-day backlog (audit § 7 — "Scale to thousands of listings")

- [ ] **Server-side pin clustering** — Postgis `ST_ClusterDBSCAN` on bbox queries. API returns clusters at the user's viewport zoom; client never holds 1000+ pins.
- [ ] **Heatmap layer** — Wi-Fi speed / walkability overlay for nomad targeting.
- [ ] **Drawing tools** — drag a polygon to filter listings to a custom area ("only these 4 blocks").
- [ ] **Walking-distance circles** — draw a 15-min walk radius around a selected pin.
- [ ] **A/B framework via PostHog** — depends on PostHog wiring (Day 2). Run experiments on map UX changes.
- [ ] **Service-worker cache for Maps tile layer** — LATAM 4G first-paint perf.

## Week 2 exit test (§5 of `tasks/CHAT-CENTRAL-PLAN.md`) — **all 5 prerequisites shipped**

- [ ] **Run end-to-end on prod** (post-merge): logged-in user searches rentals → saves 2 listings (`saved_places` rows exist) → adds 1 to a new trip (`trip_items` row exists) → clicks outbound to Airbnb → click logged to `outbound_clicks` with affiliate tag.

**5 of 5 prerequisites done** ✓ chat ✓ Save ✓ Add-to-trip ✓ social proof ✓ affiliate attribution + outbound-click logging. The only remaining step is the live end-to-end run after PR #6 merges + `supabase db push` deploys the migration.

## DONE 2026-04-24 — Maps stabilization sprint + Quick Wins audit

### Shipped (commits on `fix/chat-production-hardening`)
- [x] **Singleton Google Maps loader** → `src/lib/google-maps-loader.ts` (commit `e00b872`). Idempotent across StrictMode + remounts. Detects pre-existing `<script id="google-maps-script">` and reuses it. Killed the duplicate-script + `gmp-* already defined` error class.
- [x] **`gmp-click` migration** + `gmpClickable: true` + symmetric `removeEventListener` cleanup on unmount (ChatMap + GoogleMapView). Killed the deprecation warning + listener leaks.
- [x] **anon UUID hardening** (`c9ea238`) — `useAnonSession` validates with strict UUID regex + `crypto.randomUUID()` polyfill; `useChat` synthetic anon conversation id is now a pure UUID. Realtime subscription gated on `conversation.user_id === user.id`. Killed `invalid input syntax for type uuid` + `CHANNEL_ERROR`.
- [x] **CommonJS `require()` panel-context shim removed** (`9b86f72`) — `/apartments/:id` no longer renders blank.
- [x] **Quick Win #1: Maps SDK `v=quarterly` in prod** (`63d3faf`) — tree-shake-verified; `weekly` channel only in dev.
- [x] **Quick Win #4: `clearPins()` on conversation change** (`63d3faf`) — pins no longer bleed across conversations.
- [x] **Quick Win #5: A11y on AdvancedMarkerElement** (`63d3faf`) — `role`, `aria-label`, `aria-current`, `aria-hidden` on emoji.
- [x] **Quick Win #2: pluggable maps telemetry** (`b054b08`) — 9 event kinds wired (script_loaded, markers_rendered, fitbounds, pin_click, cluster_expand, auth_failed, etc.); 4/4 unit tests; default sink is structured console; replace once at app boot to forward to Sentry/PostHog.
- [x] **Quick Win #3: MarkerClusterer** (`ae918f7`) — `@googlemaps/markerclusterer ^2.6.2`. Pins cluster to numbered bubbles at city zoom, fan out on zoom-in. Cluster-click telemetry wired.
- [x] **Booking flow** (`c0caa97`) — multi-step BookingDialog (dates → review → success), ContactHostDialog with pre-filled message, pricing engine (12 unit tests), uses existing `bookings` + `leads` tables (no migration).
- [x] **Maps audit verified** — 21/21 verification items pass; no critical hidden bugs; production readiness **92/100**.

### Verification table
| Verified | Result |
|---|---|
| Singleton loader; no duplicate scripts; no `gmp-* already defined` | ✅ |
| `gmp-click` everywhere; `gmpClickable: true` | ✅ |
| Pin click → `/apartments/:id`; Cmd/Ctrl-click → new tab | ✅ |
| MarkerClusterer + cluster_expand telemetry | ✅ |
| `clearPins` on conv switch | ✅ |
| A11y: tab/Enter/Space/aria-* | ✅ (visible focus = browser default; cosmetic gap only) |
| Telemetry events fire (9 kinds) | ✅ default sink is `console.debug` — set DevTools to "Verbose" to see them |
| E2E chat from prod origin | ✅ 200 OK, 9 listings, 2 phase events |
| Memory leaks across navigation | ✅ unmount cleanup is symmetric |

### Known gaps (informed roadmap, not bugs)
- [ ] **No Sentry / PostHog sink** — telemetry events fire but go to console only.
- [ ] **`viewport_idle` telemetry event TYPED but not EMITTED** — wired with "Search this area" feature.
- [ ] **MapProvider is chat-only** — apartment detail and trips pages don't share pin state.
- [x] ~~**Bundle 1.81 MB / ~480 KB gzip**~~ — **resolved 2026-04-28 late-night**. Entry chunk down to 118 KB gzip after vendor splitting + route-level lazy loading. See changelog for full breakdown.
- [ ] **`npm run verify:edge` broken** (pre-existing) — `p1-crm/index.ts` deno-imports `@supabase/supabase-js`.

## NEXT 10 (ranked by Revenue / Growth / UX / Tech / Speed)

| # | Task | Total |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Wednesday's `ChatLeftNav`** (chats + Saved + Trips counts) | 21 |
| 2 | **"Search this area" on viewport idle** (debounced bbox → `rentals_search`) | 21 |
| 3 | **Mobile fullscreen map drawer** (currently zero map on `md:hidden`) | 21 |
| 4 | **Thursday's SEO page → chat handoff** (`/apartments/:id` "Ask mdeai about this →") | 20 |
| 5 | **InfoWindow on pin click** (peek before navigating; preserves anon chat) | 19 |
| 6 | **Sentry SDK + PostHog wired into telemetry sink** | 19 |
| 7 | **Friday's affiliate attribution + `outbound_clicks`** | 17 |
| 8 | **Booking dialog polish** (photo gallery + amenity grid in review step) | 16 |
| 9 | **Custom Cloud Console MapID** (Mindtrip-style muted palette) | 12 |
| 10 | **`useMarkerLayer` hook** (factor duplication between ChatMap + GoogleMapView) | 11 |

### Recommended sprint order (4 days)
- **Day 1**: #1 ChatLeftNav + #2 Search this area
- **Day 2**: #6 Sentry/PostHog wiring + #3 Mobile fullscreen map
- **Day 3**: #7 Affiliate attribution + #4 SEO handoff
- **Day 4**: #5 InfoWindow + #8 Booking polish

## Week 2 Remaining (chat-central plan)

- [ ] **Wed — `ChatLeftNav`** (= "Next 10 #1") — sidebar lists recent conversations + "Saved (N)" + "Trips (N)" sections.
- [ ] **Thu — SEO handoff + email-gate polish** (= "Next 10 #4")
- [ ] **Fri — Affiliate attribution + `outbound_clicks`** (= "Next 10 #7")

## Week 2 exit test (§5 of `tasks/CHAT-CENTRAL-PLAN.md`)

- [ ] Logged-in user searches rentals → saves 2 listings (`saved_places` rows exist) → adds 1 to a new trip (`trip_items` row exists) → clicks outbound to Airbnb → click logged to `outbound_clicks` with affiliate tag.

## DONE 2026-04-23 — Week 2 Mon/Tue + CORS fix + production merge

### Shipped
- [x] **PR #1 merged** → `287b1cc` → **chat canvas live on `www.mdeai.co`** (was Index marketing page). Verified: 200 OK, production bundle contains ChatCanvas / apartment_save_counts RPC name / welcome headline. End-to-end POST from prod origin returns streaming SSE with 10 Laureles listings.
- [x] **CORS fix** → `_shared/http.ts` now emits `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS` + `x-anon-session-id` in `Allow-Headers` + `Max-Age: 86400` + `Vary: Origin`. Browsers were aborting POST after preflight (logs showed OPTIONS 204, no follow-up POST). All 10 edge fns redeployed.
- [x] **Week 2 Tue** — `saved_places` toggleSave (optimistic + rollback), `AddToTripModal` (pick-existing / create-new with NOT NULL date enforcement), `apartment_save_counts` RPC (SECURITY DEFINER, no user-id leakage) for "Saved by N nomads" social proof on `RentalCardInline`.
- [x] **Week 2 Mon** — `ChatContextChips` above the message list (📍 neighborhood · 📅 dates · 👥 travelers · 💰 budget) with write-through persistence to `conversations.session_data.chat_context` (authed) / in-memory (anon); `sessionData` on every ai-chat POST + new `sessionContextBlock` inlined in the system prompt so Gemini inherits chip values.

### Known issues
- [ ] **`npm run verify:edge` broken** — `p1-crm/index.ts` imports `@supabase/supabase-js` but the script no longer runs `deno install`. Pre-existing, not introduced this session. `deno check` passes on `ai-chat` + `_shared` individually.
- [ ] **Supabase Preview CI check failing** on `main` — pre-existing, separate preview-branch system, not blocking production (Vercel passed).

## Week 2 Remaining (on `fix/chat-production-hardening` or a fresh branch)

- [ ] **Wed — `ChatLeftNav`** — sidebar lists recent conversations (title from first user msg, sorted by `last_message_at`) + "Saved (N)" + "Trips (N)" sections. Click a row → `selectConversation` (already hydrates chips). `useChat.newChat()` helper added; reuse.
- [ ] **Thu — SEO page → chat handoff** — `/apartments/:id` "Ask mdeai about this →" CTA opens `/` with listing context pre-loaded (query param or router state). Polish email-gate modal UX (copy + spacing).
- [ ] **Fri — Affiliate attribution** — new migration `20260424XXXXXX_outbound_clicks.sql` (table: `user_id nullable, listing_id, source_url, affiliate_tag, ts`). Wrap `source_url` in `ApartmentCard` / `RentalCardInline` with affiliate-tag rewriter (Airbnb + Booking.com IDs via env). Edge fn or RPC to log clicks.

## Week 2 exit test (§5 of `tasks/CHAT-CENTRAL-PLAN.md`)

- [ ] Logged-in user searches rentals → saves 2 listings (`saved_places` rows exist) → adds 1 to a new trip (`trip_items` row exists) → clicks outbound to Airbnb → click logged to `outbound_clicks` with affiliate tag.

## DONE This Session (2026-04-05) — edge + rentals polish

- [x] **`tasks/notes/06-search.md`** — Rental search strategy + meta-search (links `03-realestate-search.md`)
- [x] **`02E` prompt** — Rental **payments off-platform** (landlord/owner); booking-create / E2-009 / INDEX aligned; E2-005 Stripe webhook deferred
- [x] **`CLAUDE.md`** — **Task completion & docs** section + `verify:edge` in quick commands / git workflow (aligned with `.cursor/rules/task-completion-and-docs.mdc`)
- [x] **`tasks/prompts/core`** — **Success criteria (tests · verify · production-ready)** section added to all **20** prompt files (before **Feature success**)
- [x] **`Deno.serve`** on all edge `index.ts` (removed `std/http` `serve`)
- [x] **Per-request CORS** — `getCorsHeaders(req)` + `jsonResponse(..., req)` / SSE headers on ai-chat, ai-router, ai-search, ai-trip-planner, google-directions, rentals, ai-optimize-route, ai-suggest-collections, rules-engine; **OPTIONS → 204** where applicable
- [x] **`ai-optimize-route`** — `insertAiRun` for Gemini path (when user JWT present); shared clients + `okJson`
- [x] **`rentals` API** — legacy body/response shapes (intake, listing `listing_id`, search flat fields, verify `freshness_status`, map pin coords)
- [x] **`ApartmentRentActions`** — idempotency key rotates via **`useEffect` when dialog opens** (fixes silent CRM no-op on reopen)

## DONE Earlier (2026-04-05) — security hardening

- [x] **verify_jwt = true** on all 10 edge functions → `supabase/config.toml`
- [x] **CORS locked down** → `_shared/http.ts` now uses `getCorsHeaders(req)` with allowed origins
- [x] **Service role fix** → `_shared/supabase-clients.ts` created; applied to ai-search + ai-router
- [x] **Gemini timeout helper** → `_shared/gemini.ts` with 30s AbortController
- [x] **Frontend hardcoded URLs removed** → All 7 files now use `import.meta.env.*`
- [x] **Frontend hardcoded JWT tokens removed** → 3 files fixed
- [x] **Dead code deleted** → useIntentRouter.ts + ChatRightPanel.tsx
- [x] **Wasted ai-router call removed** → useChat.ts no longer double-calls (saves ~50% Gemini cost/message)
- [x] **Core migration created** → `20260405120000_core_phase_corrections.sql` (idempotency_keys, notifications, agent_audit_log + indexes)
- [x] **Prompts audited + fixed** → 12 core prompts corrected (wrong schemas, missing tables, route mismatches, deletion errors)
- [x] **Roadmap updated** → Booking/landlord comms, planning dashboard, WA promoted to CORE
- [x] **Full system audit** → `tasks/audit/09-full-system-audit.md` (25/100 overall, 8 CRITICAL found)
- [x] **Prompts audit** → `tasks/audit/08-prompts-audit.md` (30/100, 13 CRITICAL found)

## Week 1 Remaining: Security Follow-Through

- [ ] **Apply service role fix to ai-chat + ai-trip-planner** → same pattern as ai-search/ai-router (use `_shared/supabase-clients.ts`) — *partial: optimize-route uses shared clients; chat/trip-planner still review*
- [ ] **Apply fetchGemini() to all 8 Gemini calls** → replace bare fetch() in ai-chat (3), ai-router (1), ai-search (2), ai-trip-planner (1), ai-optimize-route (1)
- [x] **Update OPTIONS + JSON CORS** → `getCorsHeaders(req)` across browser-invoked functions (**done 2026-04-05**)
- [ ] **Apply migration** → `supabase db reset` (local) then push to hosted
- [ ] **Rotate leaked secrets** → `.env` has Shopify/Gadget tokens in Git history — rotate in Shopify/Gadget dashboards
- [ ] **Fix Vercel env vars** → Change NEXT_PUBLIC_* to VITE_* in Vercel dashboard → `09E` E9-001
- [ ] **Deploy hardened functions** → `supabase functions deploy` for all functions with `_shared` changes

## Week 2: Pipeline + Approval Workflow

- [ ] **Build application-review edge function** → host approve/reject (the missing pipeline step) → `02E`
- [ ] **Build in-app messaging** → renter ↔ landlord thread per application → `02E`
- [ ] **Build booking-create edge function** → `02E` E2-004
- [ ] **Build payment-webhook edge function** → Stripe signature verify → `02E` E2-005
- [ ] **Stripe test mode setup** → register, get test keys, configure webhook endpoint
- [ ] **Add Zod schemas to remaining 3 functions** → ai-suggest-collections, google-directions, rules-engine
- [x] **insertAiRun on ai-optimize-route** → Gemini path (**done 2026-04-05**); ai-suggest-collections is heuristic-only; rentals has no LLM

## Week 3-4: Frontend + Planning Dashboard

- [ ] **Build Planning Dashboard** → saved favorites, compare, notes → `04E`
- [ ] **Build LandlordDashboard** → listings, applications, messages, earnings → `04E`
- [ ] **Build HostApplicationReview component** → approve/reject/request-info → `04E`
- [ ] **Build MapView + PricePin components** → Google Maps integration → `04E`
- [ ] **Build ShowingScheduler component** → `04E`
- [ ] **Wire ai-search to frontend** → replace ai-chat searchMode → `04A`
- [ ] **Wire intake wizard → pipeline** → `04E`
- [ ] **Build PaymentButton + BookingConfirmation** → `04E`

## Week 5-6: First Booking Milestone

- [ ] **End-to-end booking test** → browse → detail → schedule tour → apply → host approves → pay → confirmation
- [ ] **Showing reminders** → pg_cron T-24h + T-1h → `02F`
- [ ] **Payment idempotency tests** → duplicate POST returns cached response → `13B`
- [ ] **E2E Playwright tests** → critical path automation → `09E` E9-005
- [ ] **Admin RBAC** → server-side role checks in edge functions → `13A`
- [ ] **MILESTONE: First end-to-end booking with payment** (O1)

## Week 7-8: WhatsApp v1

- [ ] **Configure Infobip WhatsApp webhook** → `08A`
- [ ] **WA lead capture edge function** → text only, calls p1-crm → `08C`
- [ ] **WA apartment search** → calls ai-search, formats top 3 → `08L`
- [ ] **WA showing reminders** → T-24h/T-1h via Infobip outbound → `02F`
- [ ] **WA booking confirmations** → via Infobip outbound
- [ ] **MILESTONE: WhatsApp lead capture + search live** (O5)

## Later (Phase 2-3) — ADVANCED

- [ ] Paperclip CEO fix + workspace binding (E5)
- [ ] Hermes intelligence scoring (E6)
- [ ] Contract automation — lease PDF analysis (E7)
- [ ] WhatsApp v2 — AI routing via OpenClaw (E8v2)
- [ ] Trio integration contract (E12)

## Testing Strategy (run continuously)

| Gate | When | Command | Pass Criteria |
|------|------|---------|---------------|
| 1. Build + Lint | Every PR | `npm run build && npm run lint` | Zero errors |
| 2. Security Grep | Every PR touching src/ or supabase/ | See §10b in progress.md | Zero hardcoded secrets |
| 3. Edge Verification | PRs touching supabase/ | `npm run verify:edge` | All Deno tests pass |
| 4. Functional Smoke | Weekly | Manual browser test (6 steps) | No CORS/401 errors |
| 5. Pipeline E2E | Before milestones | Full lead→booking flow | No FK violations or duplicates |
| 6. Deploy Checklist | Before production | Pre/post deploy script | 401 without token, HTML with token |
