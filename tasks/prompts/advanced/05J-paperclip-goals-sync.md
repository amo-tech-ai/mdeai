# E5-009: Goals, projects & dual task-system resolution

> **Why:** [`tasks/audit/03-paperclip..md`](../../audit/03-paperclip..md) — **goals/projects** not evidenced in prompts; **repo `tasks/`** vs **Paperclip issues** risk **dual brains**.  
> **Epic index:** [`05E-agent-infrastructure.md`](05E-agent-infrastructure.md)

## Feature success (goals → shippable features)

Aligned with [`PROMPT-VERIFICATION.md`](../PROMPT-VERIFICATION.md) §6 (Goal · Workflow · Proof · Gates · Rollout), [`.claude/skills/mde-writing-plans/SKILL.md`](../../../.claude/skills/mde-writing-plans/SKILL.md) (user stories + observable proof), and optionally [`.agents/skills/tasks-generator/SKILL.md`](../../../.agents/skills/tasks-generator/SKILL.md) (PRD → tasks).

| Layer | Intent |
|-------|--------|
| **Goal** | Goals sync between Paperclip and product DB is consistent or conflict is detectable. |
| **Workflow** | Define SoT → sync job → reconciliation on mismatch. |
| **Proof** | Reconciliation alerts; no silent overwrite of user data. |
| **Gates** | Design decision closed; see epic note. |
| **Rollout** | Batch sync before real users. |

## Prompt

1. **Declare source of truth (pick one):**
   - **Option A — Paperclip SoT for agent-executable work:** Issues, checkouts, approvals live in Paperclip; `tasks/prompts/*.md` are **specs** that map to issue IDs in YAML or a small `tasks/paperclip/issue-map.yaml`.
   - **Option B — Repo SoT:** Keep prompts canonical; **export** or **mirror** to Paperclip via script on release (document command in `tasks/paperclip/README.md`).

2. **Goals & projects:** For company `mde`, create **goals** aligned to phases (e.g. CORE, MVP, GTM) and attach **E5** work to **`goalId`** / **`projectId`** where the API allows. Update **05E** epic table or each 05x frontmatter with optional `paperclip_goal:` when IDs exist.

3. **Parent linkage:** Large epics use **`parentId`** so E5 children are not a **flat** backlog — mirror MERM-07 hierarchy (CEO → delegates).

4. **Weekly ritual (human):** Document **15 min** board review: stale `in_progress`, blocked dedup, budget line — link from `tasks/notes/progress-tracker.md` or `tasks/progress.md`.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] One paragraph in **`tasks/paperclip/README.md`** (create if missing) states **SoT** choice (A or B) and update cadence.
- [ ] At least **one** goal ID documented for **E5** pilot (or explicit “pending” with ticket to create goals).
- [ ] **05E** or index lists **parent epic** pattern for subtasks.
- [ ] No requirement that every dev use `/home/sk/...` — workspace paths use **env** (`MDE_ROOT`) or Paperclip workspace API (**05B**).
